I am living a hard life now.

Okay,just keep to the subject ,i'd like to share you what i am doing recently.

To be short,___Coursera___,a MOOC (massive open online courses) website where you can  learn lesson of world famous universities or colleges.

When i was still on the campus ,i think so long as i can pass all the classes then all is done,and now the job or life gives me a punch,result in a hard life. So i decide to learn as most as i can to make up for should-master knowledge,thus i meet the Coursera and here i recommend you this first level MOOC.

I enrolled 5 lessons this month,so all my rest time is consumed by this,watch the videos ,do the quizzes and assignments,discuss problems meet in the forum.

I enjoy the feel when i finish one class ,hope you can benifit from it, may be we can't be a student of top university but we can still learn the lessons as the lucky peers on that campus,a real chance to be ourselves.

>Stay hungry ,stay foolish.
